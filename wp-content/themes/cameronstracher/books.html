<p>The students at Manhattan Law School, a decrepit institution on the edge of Brooklyn's toxic Gowanus Canal, are geographically-challenged and mad as hell - in debt up to their eyeball and fighting over the few legal jobs left for those who are far outside the Ive League.</p>

<p>Adam Wright is a newly minted professor with high hopes and low expectations. But nothing has prepared him for a classroom of digitally distracted students, a rebellion of grade grubbers, a Law Journal staff at the helm of a school-wise scam, and . a corrupt administration that runs the school as it were a personal ATM. Adam regrets leaving his lucrative corporate law firm for the wilds of academia, until he finds an ally in the brilliant and fetching Laura Stapleton, a colleague with her own troubling secrets.</p>

<p>
  With its colorful cast of eccentrics and law school misfits and a satirical plot that - without too much a stretch - could be ripped from the headlines, <em>The Curve</em> is a hugely entertaining and deeply felt novel that satirizes the current state of education and reads like a cross between <em>Dangerous Minds</em> and <em>The Paper Chase.</em>

<p>Kings of the Road: How Frank Shorter, Bill Rodgers and Alberto Salazar made running go boom</p>

<p>It was 1978. Jimmy Carter was President; gas prices were soaring; and Americans were hunkering down to weather the economic crisis. But in bookstores Jim Fixx’s The Complete Book of Running was a bestseller. Frank Shorter’s gold medal in the 1972 Olympic marathon had put distance running in the mind of a public enamored of baseball and football. Suddenly, the odd activity of “jogging” became “running,” and America was in love.</p>

<p>That summer, a junior from the University of Oregon named Alberto Salazar went head to head with Olympic champion Frank Shorter and Boston Marathon champion Bill Rodgers at the Falmouth Road Race, losing in the last mile to Rodgers’s record-setting 32:21, nearly dying in the process, and setting the stage for a great rivalry. In Shorter, Rodgers, and Salazar, running had its conflict and drama like boxing had Ali and Foreman, like basketball had Russell and Chamberlain. Each man built on what the other achieved, and each pushed the other to succeed. Their successes, in turn, fueled a nation of coach potatoes to put down the remote and lace up their sneakers.</p>

<p>Hundreds of millions of people have already dies, and millions more will soon fall – victims of disease, hunger and dehydration. It is a time of drought and war. The rivers have dried up, the polar caps have melted, and drinkable water is now in the hands of the powerful few. There are fines for wasting it and prison sentences for exceeding the quotas.</p>

<p>But Kai didn’t seem to care about any of this. He stood in the open road drinking water from a plastic cup, then spilled the remaining drops into the dirt. He didn’t go to school, and he traveled with armed guards. Kai claimed he knew a secret – something the government was keeping from us…</p>

<p>And then he was gone. Vanished int he middle of the night. Was he kidnapped? Did he flee? Is he alive or dead? There are no clues, only questions. And no one can guess the lengths to which they will go to keep him silent. We have to find him – and the truth – before it’s too late for us all.</p>

<p>In Double Billing, Cameron Stracher gives us his account of the ordeal of a young associate at a major Wall Street law firm. Fresh out of law school (in Stracher’s case, Harvard), such apprentices to the bar provide the grist for the mill that will grind them into partners who can earn more than a million dollars a year by providing counsel to America’s most powerful corporations. Yet only about five percent will survive long enough to achieve that Holy Grail partnership.</p>

<p>As the author vividly describes, law school may teach you how to think like a lawyer, but it’s being an associate that teaches you how to behave like one. Or misbehave – Stracher doesn’t mice words about the outrageous practices and questionable conduct of many of the lawyers on the highest rungs of the legal profession.</p>

<p>Colin Stone, third-generationAmerican and secular Jew, is the narrator of Cameron Stracher’s debut novel, The Laws of Return. Colin lives in a world cast loose from spiritual moorings, a worlds where “kids get what they want… the Hanukkah man sees to that.” Growing up in the wealth suburbs of New York, Colin dreams of flying in the Israeli Air Force, hid “sonic boom heralding anew age”; he attends Hebrew school, and is bar-mitzvahed, but is never really touched by his religion. Embarking on a personal journey toward faith and self-discovery, he finds himself, instead, bleaching into the blond hills of western Massachusetts. Later his search takes him to the hallowed halls of Harvard Law School, and finally on an odyssey to the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>But what Colin seeks turns out to be closer to home. He falls in love with a woman who celebrates the irrational and, in a final confrontations with an unrepentant bigot, he discovers a truth that the laws of science and society cannot explain.</p>
